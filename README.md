# Description
The industrial revolution has come to Minecraft, and with it, new knowledge and discoveries both in the field of science and magic. This mod adds a multistep complex recipe for the Totem of Undying but also recipes for totems from other mods, allowing you to automate any totem you wish.

## Totem Creation

    <p>
        First step is to saw and press a tumbaga sheet to create the head casing,
        then you will then need to imbue the head with the effects of fire resistance and regeneration.
        When that is done, a tumbaga alloy is used to seal the potions and add the iconic nose,
        finishing the totem head.

        A similar process follows the creation of the totem's body.
        You simply saw and press a tumbaga alloy, and instead of potions,
        you deploy a end crystal to give the totem regenerative powers 
        and then deploy a tumbaga alloy to seal it up.

    <p>
        With both of the totem parts you can now start the assembling procedure.
        Along with the totem parts you will also need to add the emerald eyes of the totem.
        This is done by placing all the needed parts into four mechanical crafters.

    <p>
        The final part of the process, is to deploy 5 experience blocks or
        spout 135mB of liquid experience to activate the assembled totem.
